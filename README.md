# MadLibs
Randomly picks an adjective, subject and style to create a situation.

## Background
This was a fun request I got from a colleague at work. His wife works for a school and as an exercise would pick an 
adjective, style and subject creating a simple and sometimes funny situation for the kids to draw. 

Example: "Fat Ghostbusters in the style of Picasso"

I made this simple 
application to do that automatically for her based on what she includes in three files.

## How To
You can put whatever you want in the three files located in the "StreamingAssets" folder.
You can open the project in Unity, go to the Master scene under "Assets/scenes" and run the editor.

**Escape:** Quits the application / Stops the editor.<br />
**Run Button:** Creates the Madlibs type sentence.<br />
**Check Boxes Under "Adjective, Style and Subject:** Turn off that part of the Madlibs.<br />
**Search Button Next to Check Box:** Launch chrome image search on that Adjective, Style or Subject.<br />
